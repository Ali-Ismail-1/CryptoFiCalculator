# CryptoFiCalculator


# Introduction
Hi!
This is a Calculator App using Python Django, Bootstrap CSS, and jQuery. 

# Summary
This calculator app stores your calculations in a stack until you press the '=' button.
Upon hittin the '=' button, the app will make an AJAX call and send the stack to Python Django via a http GET request. 
The GET request will make the calculation and send the result back to the html page is show it in the 'display' of the calculator.
